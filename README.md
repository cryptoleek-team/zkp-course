Throughout the course, include hands-on exercises, coding sessions, and group projects to allow students to gain practical experience with ZKP systems. Here are some suggestions for activities that could be included:

- Hands-on exercises: Students could complete interactive exercises to practice writing and verifying ZKP protocols using programming languages such as Python or Rust.

- Coding sessions: Students could work on coding projects to implement various ZKP protocols, such as zk-SNARKs or Bulletproofs, using existing libraries and tools.

- Group projects: Students could work in teams to develop privacy-preserving applications using ZKP systems. For example, they could design a secure voting system or a private messaging app.

- Presentations: Students could give presentations on specific topics related to ZKPs, such as the challenges of implementing ZKPs on resource-constrained devices or the potential use cases for ZKPs in the financial industry.

- Guest speakers: Invite guest speakers who are experts in the field of ZKPs to give talks and answer questions from students. They could share insights on their research or industry experience, and provide a different perspective on the topics covered in the course.

Overall, the course should provide a comprehensive overview of ZKPs, from the foundational concepts to advanced protocols and implementation techniques. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of ZKP systems, and be able to apply this knowledge to develop practical, privacy-preserving applications.
